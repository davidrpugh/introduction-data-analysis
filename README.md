# Python for Data Analysis

This course would build on the first-year *Foundations of Data Science* course and teach students data analysis skills using Python and pandas.

Students would be expected to bring their own computers to class. Ideally I would like to have a ["flipped classroom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom): I would assign readings, video lectures, and problem sets for students to cover on their own outside of class; lectures meanwhile would focus entirely on practical applications.


## Course syllabus
Course text will be [*Python for Data Analysis*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). Book is getting a bit dated so I will supplement as necessary.

### Week 1: Introductory examples

### Week 2: IPython

### Week 3: NumPy
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is the fundamental package required for high performance scientific computing and data analysis. It is the foundation on which nearly all of the higher-level Python data analysis tools are built. 

### Week 4: Getting started with pandas
The pandas library will be the primary library of interest throughout much of the course. It contains high-level data structures and manipulation tools designed to make data analysis fast and easy in Python.

### Week 5: Data loading, storage, and file formats
The tools in this book are of little use if you can’t easily import and export data in Python. I’m going to be focused on input and output with pandas objects, though there are of course numerous tools in other libraries to aid in this process. Input and output typically falls into a few main categories: reading text files and other more efficient on-disk formats, loading data from databases, and interacting with net- work sources like web APIs.  We will cover each in turn.

### Week 6: Data wrangling
Much of the programming work in data analysis and modeling is spent on data preparation: loading, cleaning, transforming, and rearranging. The pandas librart along with the Python standard library provide you with a high-level, flexible, and high-performance set of core manipulations and algorithms to enable you to wrangle data into the right form without much trouble.

### Week 7: Plotting and visualization

### Week 8: Data aggregation and group operations

### Week 9: Time series

### Week 10: Financial and Economic data applications
