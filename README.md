# Python for Data Analysis

This course would build on the first-year *Foundations of Data Science* course and teach students data analysis skills using Python and Pandas

Students would be expected to bring their own computers to class. Ideally I would like to have a ["flipped classroom"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom): I would assign readings, video lectures, and problem sets for students to cover on their own outside of class; lectures meanwhile would focus entirely on practical applications.


Course text will be [*Pythion for Data Analysis*](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920023784.do). Book is getting a bit dated so I will supplement as necessary.

## Course syllabus
Course will basically follow the text book.
